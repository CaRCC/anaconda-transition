How to provide an anaconda equivalent software module - how to convert an existing anaconda set up and modify/redeploy it using different package manager and conda-forge channels

Involve developers of minforge/conda-forge/bioconda or other conda potentials such as pixi

Coordinated lobbying/advocacy effort to support development of alternative to Anaconda - similar to scientific python

What practices would put an institute at risk of non-compliance

conda-forge is maintained by anacondaâ€™s core team so they may be biased!

a simple script one can direct at an already deployed anaconda environment, and attempt to redeploy it as a free-as-in-free-beer environment, by modifying the yaml of the environment export, perhaps

We should also have definitions/connotations of conda/Conda/Anaconda. This may have been done in the email discussion or I may be mistaking an article I read a while ago.

An overview of the related packaging ecosystem and their license stipulations would help: conda, mamba, miniconda, micromamba, uv, pixi, etc.

Standardized language and connotations. Conda environments, Anaconda, conda, mini conda, etc?
